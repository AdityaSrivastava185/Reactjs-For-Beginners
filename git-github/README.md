## Introduction

**Git** is a powerful distributed version control system that allows you to track changes to your code, manage different versions of a project, and collaborate with others. **GitHub** is a web-based platform that hosts Git repositories, providing features for collaboration, code review, and project management.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have:

- Basic knowledge of command-line interfaces (CLI).
- Git installed on your machine. Download it from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/).
- A GitHub account. Sign up at [github.com](https://github.com/) if you don't have one.

## Getting Started

To begin learning Git and GitHub:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/learn-git-and-github.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Directory**: Change to the cloned directory:

   ```bash
   cd learn-git-and-github
   ```

3. **Explore the Documentation**: Open the files in this repository to learn about Git and GitHub concepts and commands.

## Core Concepts

### Git

- **Repository**: A collection of files and their version history. It can be local or remote.
- **Commit**: A snapshot of your changes. Each commit has a unique ID.
- **Branch**: A separate line of development. Create branches to work on features independently.
- **Merge**: Combining changes from different branches.
- **Clone**: Copying a repository from a remote source to your local machine.
- **Add**: Staging changes to prepare them for a commit.
- **Pull**: Fetching and integrating changes from a remote repository.
- **Push**: Uploading your local commits to a remote repository.
- **Status**: Checking the state of your working directory and staging area.
- **Log**: Viewing the commit history.

### GitHub

- **Repository**: A hosted Git repository on GitHub. It can be public or private.
- **Fork**: A copy of a repository under your GitHub account.
- **Pull Request (PR)**: Proposing changes to be merged into another branch.
- **Issue**: Tracking tasks, bugs, or feature requests.
- **Actions**: Automating workflows like CI/CD.
- **GitHub Pages**: Hosting static websites from a GitHub repository.
- **Collaborators**: Users with access to a repository.

## Basic Git Commands

- **Initialize a Repository**:

  ```bash
  git init
  ```

- **Check Status**:

  ```bash
  git status
  ```

- **Add Changes**:

  ```bash
  git add <file>
  ```

- **Commit Changes**:

  ```bash
  git commit -m "Commit message"
  ```

- **View Commit History**:

  ```bash
  git log
  ```

- **Create a Branch**:

  ```bash
  git branch <branch-name>
  ```

- **Switch Branches**:

  ```bash
  git checkout <branch-name>
  ```

- **Merge Branches**:

  ```bash
  git merge <branch-name>
  ```

- **Push Changes**:

  ```bash
  git push origin <branch-name>
  ```

- **Pull Changes**:

  ```bash
  git pull origin <branch-name>
  ```

## Basic GitHub Features

- **Fork a Repository**: Create a personal copy of a repository.
- **Open a Pull Request**: Propose changes and request a review.
- **Create an Issue**: Track bugs, tasks, or feature requests.
- **View Actions**: Monitor and manage automated workflows.
- **Host a GitHub Page**: Create and publish a static website.
